To start the analysis, we should bring our focus to top countries first. To do that we first examine the countries based on their total investments in intangibles.

1. We first checked that the countries that are going to be selected are in Europe. The list of the European country codes is as follows:
    ```AT, IE, CZ, LV, RO, FI, BG, IT, MT, ES, SE, FR, DK, LT, NL, EE, SI, UK, HR, PL, SK, HU, LU, PT, EL, DE, CY, BE```

2. Then, we selected the countries which we had enough data about (Not selecting countries which we do not have enough data about). So, then the list would be this:
    ```AT, BG, CZ, DE, DK, EL, FI, FR, HU, IT, LV, NL, RO, SE, SK, UK```

3. We then plotted the total intangible and total tangible investments of these selected countries, set the base to 1999 and observed the chart below which shows that the growth in intangible investment is more that the one in tangibles.

4. Then, we of course converted the amount of investments of those countries which do not use Euro to Euro based on the official data from ECB (European Central Bank) which was from 1999 onwards. So, because of that we used the data from the year 1999.

5. Based on that we charted investments in intangibles and also the ratio of intangible investment compared to total investment (intangibles + tangibles).
![00-Intangible amount yearly](figures/01-intangible_eu_yearly.png)
![02-Intangible ratio yearly](figures/02-relative_intangible_eu_yearly.png)

So, the top 5 countries based on the amount of intangible investments are: ```UK, DE, FR, IT, NL```
And the top 10 countries in regards of the ratio of intangible investment compared to total investments are: ```HU, EL, UK, SE, NL, FI, FR, DK, DE, IT```

Finding out that the top 5 countries are also the top 10 performers in the ratio of intangibles, we selected ```UK, DE, FR, IT, NL``` as the top 5 performers for further investigation.

Step 0 â€“ General Insights:
- Comparison of Italy vs EU and Top 5/X EU countries:
  - Trends in total intangible investment as a percentage of ~~GDP~~ or total (tangible + intangible) investments.

  As shown in the above chart, Italy has been investing more in Intangibles during the years. But from around the year 2010, the growth in investment rate of intangibles in top 3 countries UK, France, and Germany has been more than Italy and Italy has been almost on par with Netherlands and Sweden in terms of growth in intangible investments.
  One finding worth mentioning is That Germany has been seriously investing more in intangibles from 2010 and has well passed France in that regard.

  - Examine whether Italy has followed or deviated from global and European trends.
  As for growth, Italy has been investing in intangibles with almost a steady growing rate but it is going to be well behind UK, France, and Germany if the investment growth remains the same.

  - Identify any significant performance gaps between Italy and the EU average or top performers.
  Comparing to EU average, Italy has invested more than most of the countries but still behind top 3 performers which are UK, Germany, and France.

  - Explore specific periods where Italy either lagged or outperformed others and analyze possible causes.
  Already answered.

  - Investigate which sectors contributed most to strengths or weaknesses during those periods.
  The period of 2010 to 2021: The 3 countries of the UK, Germany and France outperformed Italy in this period on growing their intangible investments.

  The intersection of the top 10 sectors in which these 3 countries had the largest growth of intagible investment are as follows: ```Administrative and support service activities, Financial and insurance activities, Human health and social work activities, Information and communication, Manufacturing, Professional,scientific and technical activities, Public administration and defence; compulsory social security, Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles```

  How these 3 countries, Italy, and Netherlands performed in these sectors from an intangible investment perspective:
    | Country     | Average changes (%) | Average changes Millions of Euros |
    | ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | UK          | 67.05               | 15005.62                          |
    | Germany     | 75.93               | 16015.60                          |
    | France      | 50.98               | 11801.07                          |
    | Italy       | 24.71               | 3728.33                           |
    | Netherlands | 63.17               | 4172.12                           |

    Italy has been lagging by not investing in those sectors while top 3 countries of UK, Germany, and France has been doing this since 2010. Netherlands has significantly increased the ratio of investments in the mentioned sectors, but it was not a large amount.
